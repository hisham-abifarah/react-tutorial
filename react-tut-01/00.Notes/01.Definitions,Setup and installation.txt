redux - react - browser

user enters domain
react starts requests list of data 
redux goes to server, fetch data, stores inside redux
list of data from redux passed to react component then rendered to screen

redux: easy management library for states object
redux: big object to store data inside and data will advise react how to behave


. create new project - create react app 

. install redux and react-redux (connects react to redux)
  npm install redux react-redux

  .setup:

import provider
Provider : to connect redux

 wrap app with provider :

 ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider>
        <App />
    </Provider>
, document.getElementById('root'));

. Provider requires createStore  ==> import it 

. applyMiddleware : acts between redux and react component


what is middleware?
-------------------
app > server > redux > middleware > react component > app

an app requests data from server,
data stored in redux,
redux passes data to react component,
react component renders on screen,

middleware: grab info from redux, do something
with it before it goes to component


implement store and middleware
-------------------------------
tell Provider we are using redux
2 ways:

1.Provider store={createStore} // will work but we need to use middlewares too 

// create store with middleware
2. const createStoreWithMiddleware = 
applyMiddleWare()(createStore)

then <Provider store = {createStoreWithMiddleware()}>

setup will still not work cause store expects reducer.
