dispatching actions
-------------------

with : mapDispatchToProps in connect 

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
    return {
        getMovies:()=>{
            dispatch(moviesList());
        },
        getDirectors:()=>{
            dispatch(directorsList());
        }
    }
}


that's how we dispatch actions with mapDispatchToProps in connect
but when we have a lot of actions we shouldn't return them all like that 

solution is to use bindActionCreators ,  import them then
//1st param is the list of all actions , bindActionCreators will handle function logic for us

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
    return bindActionCreators({
        moviesList,
        directorsList
    }, dispatch);
}
