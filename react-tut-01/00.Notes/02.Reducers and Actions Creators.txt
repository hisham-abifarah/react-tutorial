reducers and object creators workflow
-------------------------------------
action creator will be called first 
returns object with a type and a payload
object searches all reducers for reducer we created for this action
then it will update the redux state, once state is updated react will re-render and display information we need on the screen

more workflow
-------------

client > 
action Creator: >
 return {
   type:"MOVIES",
   payload:{
   		movies: {movies list}
   }
}

Returns an object with an Action type and a Payload >
sent to all reducers >
match the type name with the reducer assigned for this type >
Reducer : >
	payload {
		movies : {list of movies}
	}

client updated with list of movies from reducer

explanation
-----------
app should render a list of movies
first ation creator goes to server brings data we need and once is done, returns an object contains a type and a payload
type is an id (keyword) , payload contains information we got from server (list of movies) 

action creator returns object, redux send object  this to all reducers
reducers receive object , match the type and searches all reducers to find reducer with type Movies  assigned for this job (movie reducer)

once reducer is found, reducer passes and updates redux states, redux state tells app we have list of movies so render list on screen

Create reducers:
-----------------
src > reducers folder > index.js + all reducers.js
